## Testomat.io Pipe

![](./images/testomatio.png)

Testomat.io Pipe sends data to [Testomat.io Application](https://app.testomat.io). Testomat.io provides free projects forever and unlimited test runs. Even it is a cloud application you can use it for free.

**ðŸ”Œ To enable Testomat.io pipe set `TESTOMATIO` environment variable with API key provided by Testomatio.**


```
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} <actual run command>
```

Here are some possible use cases where you can use additional configuration on reporter:

### Create Unmatched Tests

Testomat.io will not create tests from the report if they have not been previously imported. To create tests during the report `TESTOMATIO_CREATE` option can be used:

```bash
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} TESTOMATIO_CREATE=1 <actual run command>
```

### Add Report to Run by ID

This feature is widely used when a run is executed on CI.
A run is created before the test is started and it is marked as `scheduled`. Then
a report is assigned to that run using `TESTOMATIO_RUN` environment variable and `{RUN_ID}` of a run:

```bash
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} TESTOMATIO_RUN={RUN_ID} <actual run command>
```

### Do Not Finalize Run

If multiple reports are added to the same run, each of them should not finalize the run. 
In this case use `TESTOMATIO_PROCEED=1` environment variable, so the Run will be shown as `Running`

```
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} TESTOMATIO_PROCEED=1 TESTOMATIO_RUN={RUN_ID} <actual run command>
```

After all reports were attached and run can be execute the following command:

```
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} TESTOMATIO_RUN={RUN_ID} npx start-test-run --finish
```

### Setting Report Title

Give a title to your reports by passing it as environment variable to `TESTOMATIO_TITLE`.

```bash
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} TESTOMATIO_TITLE="title for the report" <actual run command>
```

### Reporting Parallel Execution to To Same Run

Provide a shared unique title to all runs that will be running in parallel, and add `TESTOMATIO_SHARED_RUN` environment var. So all reports will be sent to this run.

```bash
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} TESTOMATIO_TITLE="report for commit ${GIT_COMMIT}" TESTOMATIO_SHARED_RUN=1 <actual run command>
```

We recommend using a commit hash as a title to create a new Run. In this case we ensure that run title is unique and will be the same for all parallel jobs running exactly for this commit.


### Adding Report to RunGroup

Create/Add run to group by providing `TESTOMATIO_RUNGROUP_TITLE`:

```sh
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} TESTOMATIO_RUNGROUP_TITLE="Build ${BUILD_ID}" <actual run command>
```

### Adding Environments to Run

Add environments to run by providing `TESTOMATIO_ENV` as comma seperated values:

```bash
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} TESTOMATIO_ENV="Windows, Chrome" <actual run command>
```

### Starting an Empty Run

If you want to create a run and obtain its `{RUN_ID}` from [testomat.io](https://testomat.io) you can use `--launch` option:

```bash
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} npx start-test-run --launch
```

This command will return `{RUN_ID}` which you can pass to other jobs in a workflow.

> When executed with `--launch` a command provided by `-c` flag is ignored

### Manually Finishing Run

If you want to finish a run started by `--launch` use `--finish` option. `TESTOMATIO_RUN` environment variable is required:

```bash
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} TESTOMATIO_RUN={RUN_ID} npx start-test-run --finish
```

### Setting Build URL

When running on CI reporter tries to detect automatically the URL of the current build. This URL will be set to Run report. Reporter automatically detects build URL for following CI services:

* GitHub Actions
* Azure Devops
* Jenkins
* CircleCi
* Gitlab CI

If you are using a different CI or you want to override build url run tests with `BUILD_URL` environment variable:

```bash
TESTOMATIO={API_KEY} BUILD_URL=<build-url> <actual run command>
```
