## GitLab Pipe

Similarly to [GitHub Pipe](#GitHub-Pipe), GitLab Pipe adds a comment with a summary of a run to a Merge Request:

This summary will contain:

- Status of a test run
- Number of failed/passed/skipped tests
- Stack traces of failing tests (first 20)
- Screenshots of failed tests (if available)
- List of 5 slowest tests

**ðŸ”Œ To enable GitLab pipe set `GITLAB_PAT` environment with GitLab Private Access Token**

### Keep Outdated Reports

If a pipeline is executed multiple times, comment with previous reports will be deleted. To keep them set `GITLAB_KEEP_OUTDATED_REPORTS=1`.
